This was a group project for NUS CS3244 Machine Learning, done using Google Colab in 2024

## Objective: to predict approval of credit card applications
Models used: Decision Tree and its ensemble methods (Random Forest, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting), as well as Logistic Regression
Evaluation metrics: F1 Score, Specificity, Matthew's Correlation Coefficient, Specificity
